Here is the updated CHANGE.log:

### 8/29/2025
+[2024-09-05]
+Updated load_image function to:
+- Spawn a new thread for each image URL that needs to be loaded using std::thread::spawn (Parallel Image Loading).
+- Changed load_image to be a standalone function (now accepts sender as an argument) so it can be called within a thread without needing to borrow the entire self instance (Static load_image Function).
+- Used reqwest::blocking::get to fetch images in the load_image function (Blocking Image Fetching).
