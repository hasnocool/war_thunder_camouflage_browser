### 8/28/2024
- Removed the section containing the "Download ZIP" button.
- Adjusted the remaining code to maintain its functionality and layout.
- Wrapped the image display section inside egui::ScrollArea::vertical(). This enables vertical scrolling for the images if they are too large to fit in the visible window area.
- Parallel Image Loading: The load_current_camo_images function now spawns a new thread for each image URL that needs to be loaded using std::thread::spawn.
- Static load_image Function: Changed load_image to be a standalone function (now accepts sender as an argument) so it can be called within a thread without needing to borrow the entire self instance.
- Blocking Image Fetching: Used reqwest::blocking::get to fetch images in the load_image function.
