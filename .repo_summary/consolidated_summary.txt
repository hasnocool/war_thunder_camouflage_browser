**1. Project Name:** War_Thunder_Camouflage_Installer
**2. Short Description:** A Rust-based program designed to download and install custom camouflage skins for the video game War Thunder.
**3. Overall Description:** The War_Thunder_Camouflage_Installer is a user-friendly tool that enables players to easily obtain and apply unique skins to their vehicles in War Thunder. This project utilizes the reqwest library for HTTP requests, zip for file manipulation, and std::fs for interacting with the operating system's file system. By providing an intuitive interface, this program empowers users to personalize their gaming experience without requiring extensive technical knowledge.
**4. Main Purpose:** I built this to make it easier for War Thunder players to find and install custom skins from various online sources, reducing the hassle associated with manual downloading and installation processes.
**5. Key Technologies:**
	* Rust programming language
	* reqwest library for HTTP requests
	* zip library for file manipulation
	* std::fs for interacting with the operating system's file system
**6. Unique Features:**
	* Customizable directory structure settings to organize skins in a user-defined manner
	* Automatic skin installation from ZIP files, eliminating the need for manual extraction and placement
	* Integration with War Thunder's online features, enabling seamless updates and access to new content
**7. Future Improvements:**
	- Enhance user interface for better usability and feedback
	- Integrate with other game platforms or services (e.g., World of Tanks)
	- Implement advanced error handling and logging mechanisms
**8. Personal Notes:** As someone who's passionate about gaming and programming, I'm excited to see how this project can benefit the War Thunder community. I hope to expand its features and compatibility in the future.
