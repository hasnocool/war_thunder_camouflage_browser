# TODO: Feature Suggestions for App Enhancement

## Custom File Structures
- Add support for organizing skins into a custom file structure. Example: Userskins > [Creator] > [Skin name] - [Vehicle].
- Extract Skins from Game
- Implement functionality to pull skins directly from the game that are not easily found in the Content Development Kit (CDK). For example, DMM night camo for A6M5 Ko.

## Simplify Skin Management
- Automate the process of downloading, extracting, and renaming files to streamline the customization workflow for users.
- Custom Skin Tagging
- Allow users to add custom tags to skins for better organization and management.

## Toggle Skins Availability by Tag
- Enable or disable skins in-game based on their tags, allowing users to control which skins are active.

## Export and Import Skins by Tags
- Develop a feature to export skins by tags, allowing them to be easily imported by another user. Useful for sharing specific skin collections with friends.

## Import Skins from External Sources
- Support importing skins from non-War Thunder (WT) Live locations, such as basic zip/rar file imports.
- Mass Download Skins from WT Live
- Add functionality to mass download skins from WT Live based on the creator or specific tags for bulk management and customization.

## API Access to the Database
- Integrate API access to the database to enable external applications and scripts to interact with the app's data, facilitating data retrieval, updates, and management through a secure and documented API.
